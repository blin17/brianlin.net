### About

I want to bridge the understanding gap between China and America through technology, with an emphasis on language understanding. I'm also interested in exploring manufacturing and international shipping.

I worked as a Program Manager at Microsoft. I graduated from Cornell University with a Bachelors of Science in Information Science and Applied Economics. I also studied abroad at the University of Hong Kong.

At Cornell, I did research for Tanzeem Choudhury and Dan Cosley in the Information Science Department. I was also a Teaching Assistant for the Computer Science Department and I helped cofound TECH 1101, a series of seminars to help students learn how to get an internship.
