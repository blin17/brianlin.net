# Moving on from Seattle

#### January 29th, 2016


-- Microsoft
- Year and a half
- Wasn't the right fit

-- Thankful for
- Sunrise dragonboat gave me a family here



-- What I'm doing next


Today is my last day at Microsoft. After a year and a half of working here, I've decided to make a move: I'm leaving Seattle and moving to Beijing. 



I'm feeling a stir of emotions, but mostly fear and excitment.
