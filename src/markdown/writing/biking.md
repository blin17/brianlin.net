Biking from NYC to Princeton

Yesterday I biked from New York City to Princeton. It was the first time biking a long distance since Taiwan. Both times, Gary was my bike-mate.

When I left my house at 7:30AM, I was shivering because it was only 40 degress. Only wearing heat tech, hoodie, and shorts, I biked the L train station where I woud meet Gary at the end of the time. We originally planned to meet at 8:00AM at Union Square, so I knew I was going to be late. But after calling Gary on the train, I found out that he hadn't left his house yet. It relieved me of my guilt from texting this girl instead of getting ready earlier.

The early morning ride was pretty disappointing. We zig-zagged through the city streets of Newark to the outside suburbs. We biked from suburb to suburb, each one failing in comparison to Taiwan. It continued on monotonously unitl we reached the Delaware Trail.

As we approach the trailhead, a couple approached us to ask if we could take their picture. We continue talking and eventually they let us know that this trail went straight through Princeton and onto Delware. After following Google Maps for the first three hours, I was relieved to escape technology and retreat to nature.

The trail ran besides two rivers, one on the left and on the right. The outer borders were lined with 10 foot trees that were painted with autumn colors. The path was just wide enough for two unpaved dirt lanes. And we biked on those lanes, straight to Princeton.
