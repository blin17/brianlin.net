# Microfrustrations
#### March 12, 2016

After moving to Beijing, it feels like there have been a large number of things that frustrate me. The brown tint in the sky, my chargers not working most of the time, the lack of accessible drinking water near me, my VPN not working because of National Lianghui, getting ripped off for a phone card, drivers coming within 2 inches of hitting me every time they make a turn, waking up at night gasping for air because the PMI is 350, and just not being to express myself everyday because of a language barrier. These are my micro-frustrations. 

Thinking about these misfortunes inevitablity put the idea of escape in my head. An image of Hong Kong pops up; a city in Asia where people are friendlier, without VPN restrictions, and less of a language barrier. Or Kyoto. Or Los Angelos. Maybe I made a mistake in choosing Beijing. I misjudged the smog for one. It's a lot different than what I imagined it would be. My motivation for learning Chinese has waned. If one thinks about it, the world is endless, so why settle for Beijing. 

And then it hits me. This is what making a decision for myself means. To choose something and stick with it for the sole reason that I chosen it. There are times where I'm going to want to leave, but I need to fight it. And fight it. Until I have no more fight in me left. And then I move on.
