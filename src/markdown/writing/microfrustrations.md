# Microfrustrations
#### March 12, 2016

After moving to Beijing, it feels like there have been a large number of things that frustrate me. The brown tint in the sky, my chargers not charging 40% of the time, the lack of accessible drinking water, my VPN not working because of National Lianghui, getting ripped off by a Chinese phone company, drivers coming within 2 inches of hitting me when they make a turn, waking up at night gasping for air because the air is so shitty, and just not being to express myself everyday because of a language barrier. These are my micro-frustrations. 

Thinking about this inevitablity put the idea of escape in my head. An image of Hong Kong pops up; a city in Asia where people are friendlier and the city is safer. Or Kyoto. Or Los Angelos. 

Maybe I made a mistake in choosing Beijing. I misjudged the smog for one. It's a lot different than what I imagined it would be. My motivation for learning Chinese has waned. If I think about it, the world is endless, so why settle for living in Beijing. 

And then it hits me. This is what making a decision for myself means. To choose something and stick with it for the sole reason that I chosen it. There are times where I'm going to want to leave, but I need to fight it. Until I have no more fight in me left. And then and only then can I move on.
