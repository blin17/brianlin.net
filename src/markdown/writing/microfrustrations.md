# Microfrustrations
#### March 12, 2016

After moving to Beijing, I constantly feel frustrated. The blue-brown tint in the sky. My chargers not charging 40% of the time. And the lack of accessible drinking water. And my VPN not working because of National Lianghui. And getting ripped off by a Chinese phone company. And drivers coming within 2 inches of hitting me when they make a turn. And finally waking up at night gasping for air because the air quality is so shitty. And I can't get angry at merchant because of how bad my Chinese is.

I sit in my bed, in half-lotus position with my hands on my knees, meditating on my fate in Beijing. And then an image of Hong Kong pops up. And Kyoto. And Los Angeles. 

Maybe I made a mistake in choosing Beijing. I underestimated the smog for one. It's a lot worse than my summer internship. My motivation for learning Chinese has waned. When I first came here, I immersed myself in Chinese, but this time I just get by with what I know. And if I really think about it, the world is endless, so why should I settle for living in Beijing. 

And then it hits me that this is what making a decision for myself means. To choose something and stick with it because of my childhood desire to live in Asia. And then remind myself of my purpose whenever disappointments arise.
