## Keeping in Touch with Friends

#### Feb 20 2015

My dad told me: "When you're at home, you rely on your family. After you leave home, you rely on your friends." 

In college, I never made an effort to keep in contact with my close friends. We'd just always keep in touch somehow. I would bump into Jeff Wai coming home from class and we'd arrange dinner for the following week. Or I'd hit up my ping pong rival, David Anthony, whenever I was feeling that itch. Or there'd be a Friday night rager at Sasha's house and I'd see everyone I knew.

But after graduating, it all changed. Everyone went their separate ways. And I was alone in Seattle. So after a long draught of no contact, I realized that in order to keep in touch with my close friends, I would need to devise a system to remind me to call my friends.

Hence my friend logger:

Now that I've used this system for a few months, its become part of my routine. Every two weeks, I will scan my log and have this internal dialogue:  
- Who haven't I talked to recently?   
- How often do I usually talk to this person? (Every week? month? four months?)  
- Alright let's go message them on facebook to schedule a call or vidchat  

One big issue now is that I'm moving to China, I won't have access to Facebook due to the Great Firewall. I guess I could make all of my close friends download WeChat. But instead, I'll just create a Virtual Private Network (VPN).

So bare with me. The most straightforward way is to buy a service like [ExpressVPN](https://www.expressvpn.com/) that sets up the server for you. But that's no fun. So I set up one myself. Instructions on doing that [here](/blog/2016-02-20-vpn-digital-ocean).
