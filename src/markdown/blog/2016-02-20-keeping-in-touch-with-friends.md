# Keeping in Touch with Friends

#### February 20, 2015

In college, I never worried about keeping in contact with my friends. We'd just always keep in touch somehow. I would bump into Jeff coming home from class and we'd arrange dinner for the following week. Or I'd hit up David, my ping pong rival, whenever I was feeling that itch. Or there'd be a Friday night rager at Sasha's house and I'd see everyone I knew.

But after graduating, it wasn't like that anymore. Everyone went their separate ways. And I was alone in Seattle. So after a long drought of no contact, I realized that in order to keep in touch with my close friends, I would need to devise a system to remind me to call them. 

So I created a checklist for my friends to see how often I called them. Below you can see what it looks like in my planner. [[1]](#1)

I've used this system for a few months now. Every two weeks, I'll scan my log and have an internal dialogue:  
- Who haven't I talked to recently?   
- How often do I usually talk to this person? (Every week? month? four months?)  
- Is now a good time to message them?

Then I'll end up setting up dinners, calls, or vidchats scattered across two weeks.
