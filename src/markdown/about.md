Hi there, I'm Brian Lin. 

I want to bridge the understanding gap between China and America through technology, with a big emphasis on automated language processing. I'm also very interested in exploring low-cost manufacturing and international shipping channels.

*A little about myself:* I worked as a Program Manager at Microsoft. I graduated with a Bachelors of Science in Information Science and Applied Economics from Cornell University. I also studied abroad at the University of Hong Kong.

At Cornell, I did research for Tanzeem Choudhury and Dan Cosley in the Information Science Department. I was also a Teaching Assistant for the Computer Science Department and I helped cofound TECH 1101, a series of seminars to help students learn how to get an internship.
